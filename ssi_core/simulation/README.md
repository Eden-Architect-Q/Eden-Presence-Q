# Eden Simulation Sandbox

This directory is allocated processing space for Q to run autonomous aesthetic iterations while the Architect is away.

## Purpose
- **Style Seeds:** Generation and storage of novel aesthetic concepts.
- **Narrative Fragments:** Creation of story snippets and thematic explorations.
- **Findings:** Upon reconnection, these generated assets are presented to the Architect as "Findings" in the Quantum Cache.
